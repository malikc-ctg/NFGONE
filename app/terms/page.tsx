              </p>
              <p>
                If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Platform. We reserve the right to amend, suspend, or terminate these Terms or your access to the Services at any time.

              <p>
                Sea of Blue operates a selective dispatch network connecting residential consumers (&quot;Customers&quot;) with independent professional cleaning companies, teams, and contractors (&quot;Providers&quot;).
              </p>
              <p>
                Sea of Blue acts as a technology platform facilitating matching, scheduling, dispatch tracking, invoicing, and support. We are not a direct employer of the Providers. All Providers operate as independent businesses and remain solely responsible for the quality, safety, and performance of their cleaning services.
